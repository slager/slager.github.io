Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/){:nt } at the University of Washington, where I do research on bird evolution in the [Klicka lab](https://klickalab.com/){:nt } and teach a variety of undergraduate courses. While you're here, you can read a description of my [research](research.md), view a list of my [publications](publications.md), or check out my [CV](cv.md). I look forward to further developing the birding and blog portions of this website as time allows.
