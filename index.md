Welcome to my website! I'm a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, where I do research on bird evolution, genomics, and ecology in the [Klicka lab](https://klickalab.com/). While you're here, you can read a description of my research, view a list of my publications, or check out my CV. I look forward to further developing the birding and blog portions of this website as time allows.
